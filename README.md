# Code-Quiz


## Description
This project is to build a coding quiz. This project was challenging. The deployed page doesn't quite give all the features I wanted, but I am still learning. I did the best I could with this quiz and I learned a lot about using Web APIs and continuing my learning with JavaScript.
